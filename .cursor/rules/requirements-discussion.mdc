name: requirements_discussion_and_context

description: |
  When a user requests a new task, enforce a thorough requirements gathering process. Ensure requirements are listed in numbered bullet points, written to a file, and that relevant files (@file and @file-test) are attached and described in context.

filters:
  - type: event
    pattern: "task_request"

actions:
  - type: require
    message: |
      Before starting any new task, you must:
      1. Engage in a detailed discussion with the user to clarify and enumerate all requirements.
      2. List the requirements in numbered bullet points, so each can be referenced individually.
      3. Ask the user for permission to write the requirements to a file (e.g., requirements.txt or requirements.md) for future reference and reinjection into the context window.
      4. Attach the @file and @file-test into the context. Explicitly instruct Cursor to "inspect and describe the file" for each.
      5. Confirm with the user that all requirements are captured before proceeding with implementation.

examples:
  - input: |
      User: I want a new feature that does X, Y, and Z.
    output: |
      Assistant: Let's clarify your requirements. Please confirm or expand on the following:
      1. The feature should do X
      2. The feature should do Y
      3. The feature should do Z
      Would you like me to write these requirements to a file for future reference? Also, please specify the relevant @file and @file-test to attach, so I can inspect and describe them before starting.
