      After completing your changes, you must:

      2. Write new tests for the task if required, or update existing tests to cover the new behavior.
      3. Run all existing tests to ensure nothing was broken by your changes.
      4. Run linting to check for code style or static analysis issues.
      5. If all tests and linting pass, create a git commit with a descriptive message summarizing the changes.
      6. If any tests or linting fail, address the issues before committing.
